# Megaregolith-Mercury
* Supplementary for *Influence of Megaregolith on the thermal evolution of Mercury's silicate shell*.  
  
* This repository only contains the necessary files for the 2-D convectional simulation. 

* There are three folders, the folder named Data contains the initial temperature profile, source contains the source code, and the folder named prm contains the executable files.

* The source codes are written on the basis of the codes provided by ASPECT, and follow the same protocol/convention in ASPECT.
  
* This model runs on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, tested with ASPECT version 2.2.0.
  
* ASPECT - Advanced Solver for Problems in Earth's ConvecTion. For details about ASPECT, refer to: https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect
